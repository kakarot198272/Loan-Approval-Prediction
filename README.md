# Loan Approval Prediction

A machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval decisions using
structured applicant data. The project explores classical ML models,
ensemble methods, and cost-sensitive decision-making to balance
profit and risk.

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions must decide whether to approve or reject loan
applications. Incorrect approvals can lead to defaults, while incorrect
rejections lead to missed revenue opportunities. This project models
loan approval as a binary classification problem and optimizes decisions
using business-aware cost functions.
